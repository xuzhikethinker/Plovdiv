        <h1>Plovdiv</h1>

<p>Project Plovdiv is a network epidemiology simulator and can be used to teach basic graph theory. It is primarily aimed at students and demonstrates some of the basic concepts of graph theory and epidemiology. Nodes in the graph (individuals) can be infected or vaccinated, and several different types of epidemics can be visualised.</p>

<p>This application is based on two separate pieces of software. The first one was developed under the York Transit Bursary Scheme under the supervision of Dr Daniel Franks, and the second at the University of Sussex under Dr Istvan Kiss. It is not intended for detailed modelling or efficient calculations but rather as a  supplementary course resource. Our main goals throughout the development process were simplicity and ease of use as well as mathematical and biological correctness.
The application is distributed under a three-clause BSD license. This allows unlimited redistribution for any purpose as long as its copyright notices and the license's disclaimers of warranty are maintained. The license also contains a clause restricting use of the names of contributors for endorsement of a derived work without explicit prior permission.</p>

<p>A brief user manual is available in the docs/ directory. Please report any bugs you discover to the developers. If you find this piece of software useful, you are welcome to contribute to it.</p>
